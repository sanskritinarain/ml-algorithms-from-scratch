Types of Machine Learning

Machine Learning can be classified based on the type of data available and how learning happens. The four main types are:

1.Supervised Learning
2.Unsupervised Learning
3.Semi-Supervised Learning
4.Reinforcement Learning

Supervised Learning
Definition - Supervised Learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on a labeled dataset, each input data point is associated with a known output (target).
The goal is to learn a mapping between input and output so the model can predict correct outputs for unseen data.

Key Characteristics

Data is labeled
Requires input–output pairs
Used for prediction and classification tasks

Real-world Examples

Predicting house prices (price is known)
Email spam detection (spam / not spam)
Predicting student grades
Disease prediction

Algorithms Used

Linear Regression
Logistic Regression
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Support Vector Machine (SVM)


Unsupervised Learning
Definition - Unsupervised Learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on unlabeled data, meaning no predefined output labels are available.
The goal is to discover hidden patterns, structures, or groupings in the data.

Key Characteristics

No labeled output
Focuses on pattern discovery
Used for clustering and dimensionality reduction

Real-world Examples

Customer segmentation
Grouping similar products
Market basket analysis
Image compression

Algorithms Used

K-Means Clustering
Principal Component Analysis (PCA)


Semi-Supervised Learning
Definition - Semi-Supervised Learning is a hybrid approach where the model is trained using a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data.
It is useful when labeling data is expensive, time-consuming, or difficult.

Key Characteristics

Combines labeled and unlabeled data
Improves accuracy compared to unsupervised learning
Common in real-world large datasets

Real-world Examples

Image classification with limited labeled images
Speech recognition systems
Medical image analysis

Algorithms / Techniques Used

Self-training models
Label propagation
Semi-supervised SVM


Reinforcement Learning
Definition - Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an agent learns by interacting with an environment and improves its behavior based on rewards and penalties.
The goal is to learn an optimal policy that maximizes cumulative reward over time.

Key Characteristics

No labeled dataset
Learning through trial and error
Uses reward signals
Sequential decision-making

Real-world Examples

Game playing (Chess, Go)
Robotics
Self-driving cars
Recommendation systems (dynamic)

Algorithms Used
Q-Learning
